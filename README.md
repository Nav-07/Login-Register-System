# Login Register System
This REST API is a basic implementation of a secure Login and Register System using JSON Web Tokens and Python3 and Flask and JSON.

The System is kind-of completed but still requires encryption of password and some other stuff, but in the one hour of development Nav was able to add Mailing System, SMS System and the JSON Web Tokens, this is the second last project before Nav starts to develop his own blog.

**Started and Completed on 8 June 2020**
